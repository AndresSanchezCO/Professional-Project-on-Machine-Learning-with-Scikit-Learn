## Machine Learning Repository

In this repository, I develop various machine learning algorithms from the categories of supervised and unsupervised learning. The categories include XGBoosting, Random Forest, Decision Trees, K-means, among others.

### Feature Engineering
I individually engineer features by hand, prioritizing error and accuracy metrics to improve model performance.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I conduct exploratory data analysis on different datasets to gain insights and better understand the data.

### Automatic Parametric Optimization
I perform automatic parametric optimization using GridSearch and RandomizedSearch to find the best combination of hyperparameters for the algorithms. The winning algorithm with the highest score is exported.

### Model Deployment
Finally, I productivize the model by importing the previously optimized model and deploy it as an API using Flask. This allows easy integration with any server, making it possible to deploy the model on various server vendors.
